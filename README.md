# Dream_It-Build_It
## Introduction to building electronic systems


This is a short course for folks with no experience building electronic systems. It focuses on using embedded microcontrollers, sensors and actuators to create objects that are of interest to *you*. It is derived from a popular three-week residential course for rising sophomores at Stanford University. Since there is no time constraint in this format, some topics have been added and others expanded to create a more complete exposition.


Overall, this course is designed as a crash-course in making embedded, cloud connected systems. The idea is that you will learn much more by building, debugging, and demonstrating a system than by taking any other approach.


This is NOT for the faint of heart and you will probably find that you (and your fellow students) will put in a lot of time and mental effort to get things built and working.


One of the key motivators for the course is the development of a project concept - something you wish you had but cannot easily purchase. There have been a wide variety of projects limited only by our imaginiations! Some of these have included -
* bike locators - an electronic device to locate your bike / report if it has been moved
* electronic etch-a-sketch - an electronic version of an etch-a-sketch that erases when you turn it upsidedown and shake it
* nerf cannons - nerf guns that automatically adjust for the target distance
* smart mirrors - dorm room mirrors that present data / have AI properties
* any number of RC car-style robots, etc.
  
And so many more!!
The important thing is that you have a project to build up so you know that you are mastering skills and releasing your inner engineer! There is nothing that builds confidence faster than success with some aspect of your project, so please enjoy the experience!

## What do we need?
Since this course involves physical hardware, you'll need some, well... hardware! You'll find a list of helpful hardware stuff here. You don't need everything before you begin! To get going you just need the microcontroller and a suitable USB cable! Because this is an introductory course with no prior knowledge required, we have chosen to use a microcontroller board that runs CircuitPython (not Arduino). We find this makes getting started much easier and the microcontroller *can* be used with the Arduino IDE.

## Why this course?

Electronic systems are truly everywhere in the modern world. From cell phones and laptop computers to drones, web-enabled doorbells, and little devices that you command to make your life easier (Hey, Siri, are you listening?), small embedded devices are an integral part of our lives. So useful; but how much do we really know about how these work? Are we at the mercy of those who build and program them? Or can WE take control?


Traditionally, electrical engineering has taken a "bottom-up" approach to understanding how devices and systems work. With today's focus on making things happen quickly and effectively, this may be a luxury we can no longer afford!


Here we take a more "top-down" approach with an emphasis on designing SYSTEMS of interest. By understanding how to select functional blocks and connect them to do our bidding we will be able to "digitize" and "connect" things so that we can use data to generate knowledge about our world.


It is our hope that by demonstrating that YOU can control, measure, connect, and calculate, YOU will be empowered to use electronics to your benefit. And we hope you will become curious about the deeper aspects of electronics, too!
